## Hi there 👋

Our team create open source user-friendly software for drones:
 - [Asv.Drones.Gui](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-drones) - Open-source cross-platform application for UAV management:
   - Can control multiple UAV
   - Support command mode: one operator control one\multiple drones
   - Work with other applications (Mission Planer, QGroundControl) on the same network
   - Extensible plugin interface ([weather example](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-drones-gui-weather))
   - Multiple ports: TCP_CLIENT, TCP_SERVER, UDP, SERIAL
 - [Asv.Drones.Gbs](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-drones-gbs) - Ground base station service with RTK supprot:
   - Mavlink router with multiple ports: TCP_CLIENT, TCP_SERVER, UDP, SERIAL
   - Supports various GNSS receiver manufacturers
   - Transmits differential corrections to UAV via standard Mavlink messages
 - [Asv.Drones.Sdr](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-drones-sdr) - SDR payload to analyze radio signals in the surrounding environment

If you want DIY, we have libraries for that: 
 - [Asv.Gnss](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-gnss) - GNSS library
   - Open protocols RTCMv2, RTCMv3, NMEA, raw GPS\GLONASS frames
   - Control recievers througt SBF, ComNav, UBX protocols
 - [Asv.Mavlink](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-mavlink) - Mavlink library and code generator
   - Create your custom Mavlink messages and use them
   - You can choose simple using: send and receive Mavlink messages
   - Then connect a router and connect multiple devices
   - Or use out abstractions over devices: ArduPlane, ArduCopter, GroundBaseStation....
   - Or use out abstractions over microservices: Params, Missions...
   - There is a service to find devices in the network
   - And a lot more ...
 
Feel free to connect with us or join to the team
